     * This code is copied from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9481865/getting-the-ip-address-of-the-current-machine-using-java">a Stackoverflow post</a>.

     * </p>
     * Returns an <code>InetAddress</code> object encapsulating what is most likely the machine's LAN IP address.
     * <p/>
     * This method is intended for use as a replacement of JDK method <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>, because
     * that method is ambiguous on Linux systems. Linux systems enumerate the loopback network interface the same
     * way as regular LAN network interfaces, but the JDK <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code> method does not
     * specify the algorithm used to select the address returned under such circumstances, and will often return the
     * loopback address, which is not valid for network communication. Details
     * <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4665037">here</a>.
     * <p/>
     * This method will scan all IP addresses on all network interfaces on the host machine to determine the IP address
     * most likely to be the machine's LAN address. If the machine has multiple IP addresses, this method will prefer
     * a site-local IP address (e.g. 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x, usually IPv4) if the machine has one (and will return the
     * first site-local address if the machine has more than one), but if the machine does not hold a site-local
     * address, this method will return simply the first non-loopback address found (IPv4 or IPv6).
     * <p/>
     * If this method cannot find a non-loopback address using this selection algorithm, it will fall back to
     * calling and returning the result of JDK method <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost</code>.
     * <p/>
     *
     * @throws UnknownHostException If the LAN address of the machine cannot be found.
